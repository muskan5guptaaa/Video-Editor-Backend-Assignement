ðŸ§© Challenges and Creative Decisions
Managing multiple versions of video files without overwriting was crucial. To solve this, I separated files into /uploads, /processed, and /rendered folders.

Heavy video processing operations like trimming and adding subtitles are handled efficiently using FFmpeg.

To maintain robustness, proper error handling and input validations are implemented at every stage.

All operations are asynchronous to ensure non-blocking behavior of the Node.js server.

âœ¨ Future Improvements
Add support for multiple subtitles at once.

Allow exporting videos in different formats (e.g., .avi, .mov).

Integrate cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for uploaded and processed files.

Add basic authentication for API endpoints.
